This is because the arcsine function directly provides the correct angle in this case.\n\n   - **Case 2: Real Part < 0:** If the real part is negative, we need to adjust the angle. We have two sub-cases:\n     - **Sub-case 2a: Imaginary Part \u2265 0:** We use `B` plus a constant (\u03c0/2) to get the correct angle.\n     - **Sub-case 2b: Imaginary Part < 0:** We use `B` minus a constant (\u03c0/2) to obtain the argument.\n\n3. **Combining the Cases:** We use the `Measurable.ite` function to combine the results from these cases. This function acts like a piecewise definition, selecting the appropriate function (`A`, `B` adjusted by a constant) based on the conditions on the real and imaginary parts.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** By constructing the argument function in this way and proving the measurability of each piece and the conditions used for the case distinctions, we establish that the argument function itself is measurable.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the argument function, which determines the angle of a complex number in the complex plane, is a measurable function. This property is essential in various areas of mathematics, particularly in complex analysis and measure theory."

The function `p.toOuterMeasure` calculates the outer measure of a set `s` according to a specific rule defined by `p`. \n2. **Indicator Function:** This function, `s.indicator p x`, acts like a switch: it's 1 if the point `x` is inside the set `s` and 0 otherwise.  \n3. **Summation (\u2211'):**  We're adding things up. The symbol `\u2211'` means we're considering a potentially infinite sum over all possible points 'x'.\n4. **`tsum_congr` and `smul_dirac_apply`:** These are Lean's way of handling technicalities related to infinite sums and the special properties of multiplying by the indicator function.",
        "nl_proof": "To prove the outer measure of a set is calculated correctly, we'll look at how each point 'x' contributes to the sum:\n\n1. **If 'x' is inside the set 's':**\n    - The indicator function `s.indicator p x` is equal to 1.\n    - The term being added to the sum is then `p(x) * 1`, which is just `p(x)`.  This means the value of `p` at `x` directly contributes to the sum.\n2. **If 'x' is outside the set 's':** \n    - The indicator function `s.indicator p x` is 0. \n    -  The term being added is `p(x) * 0`, which is 0. So, points outside of 's' don't contribute to the sum.\n\nSince we are adding up `p(x)` for every point `x` inside the set `s`, and ignoring the points outside, this sum accurately represents the outer measure of `s` according to the rule defined by `p`."

It sums up the weights of all elements in \\(s\\).\n\n2. **`support`**: This represents the set of elements where the weight function \\(p\\) assigns a strictly positive value.\n\n3. **Proof Strategy**: The proof uses a two-sided implication (if and only if) and leverages proof by contradiction for one direction.\n\n    * **Direction 1 (\u2192)**: If the outer measure of \\(s\\) is 1, it aims to show that every element with a non-zero weight (i.e., in the support of \\(p\\)) must belong to \\(s\\).

This means there exists an element, let's call it 'a', which belongs to the support of \\(p\\) but not to \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Element 'a' and its weight**: Since 'a' is in the support of \\(p\\), its weight, \\(p(a)\\), is strictly greater than 0.\n\n4. **Impact on outer measure**: Because 'a' is not in \\(s\\) but has a positive weight, the outer measure of \\(s\\) would be strictly less than 1 (as we're not including the weight of 'a' in the sum).\n\n5. **Contradiction**: This contradicts our initial assumption that the outer measure of \\(s\\) is 1. Therefore, our assumption that the support of \\(p\\) is not a subset of \\(s\\) must be false.\n\n**Direction 2 (\u2190): If the support of \\(p\\) is contained within \\(s\\), then the outer measure of \\(s\\) is 1.**\n\n1. **Assumption**: Let's assume the support of \\(p\\) is a subset of \\(s\\). \n\n2. **Total Weight**: This means all elements with non-zero weight under \\(p\\) are within \\(s\\). Since the total weight assigned by \\(p\\) across all elements is 1, and all elements with non-zero weight are in \\(s\\), the outer measure of \\(s\\) (which sums the weights of elements in \\(s\\)) must be 1.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since we have proven both directions, we have shown that the outer measure of a set \\(s\\) with respect to a weight function \\(p\\) is equal to 1 if and only if the support of \\(p\\) is contained within \\(s\\). \n",

        "nl_proof": "1. The characteristic matrix of a matrix M is defined as a matrix where:\n    - The diagonal entries are calculated by subtracting C times the corresponding diagonal entry of M from X.\n    - The off-diagonal entries are calculated by subtracting C times the corresponding off-diagonal entry of M from 0.\n2. Therefore, the (i, j)-th entry of the characteristic matrix can be determined as follows:\n    - If i = j (diagonal entry): It is equal to X - C * (the (i, j)-th entry of M).\n    - If i \u2260 j (off-diagonal entry): It is equal to 0 - C * (the (i, j)-th entry of M).\n3. Notice that the diagonal matrix (Matrix.diagonal fun _ : n => X) has X in the (i, j)-th position when i = j and 0 when i \u2260 j.\n4. So, the (i, j)-th entry of the characteristic matrix can be generally expressed as the (i, j)-th entry of the diagonal matrix minus C times the (i, j)-th entry of M.\n5. This is exactly what the theorem states, and since it follows directly from the definition of the characteristic matrix, the proof is complete by reflexivity."
