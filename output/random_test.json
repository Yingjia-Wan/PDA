This property states that a number \\(n\\) in `ZMod 2` is equal to \\(0\\) if and only if \\(n\\) is divisible by the characteristic of the modulo system, which is \\(2\\) in this case. This is represented in Lean4 as `(CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff (ZMod 2) 2 n)`.\n\n2. **Definition of an Even Number**: An even number is defined as any number that is divisible by \\(2\\). This is a standard definition in mathematics. In Lean4, the equivalence of \\(n\\) being even is represented as `even_iff_two_dvd`, where `dvd` stands for \"divides\".\n\nThe proof connects these two concepts by showing that the condition of \\(n\\) being \\(0\\) in `ZMod 2` (which means \\(n \\mod 2 = 0\\)) is equivalent to \\(n\\) being divisible by \\(2\\) (which means \\(n\\) is an even number). This is achieved through the transformation of the characteristic property into the definition of an even number, facilitated by the `.trans` method in Lean4, which allows for the transformation of one equivalence into another.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that the property of a number \\(n\\) being \\(0\\) when considered under modulo \\(2\\) arithmetic is fundamentally the same as saying that \\(n\\) is an even number, as both conditions are rooted in the divisibility of \\(n\\) by \\(2\\). This equivalence is established through the logical connection between the characteristic property of `ZMod 2` and the definition of even numbers, thereby proving the theorem.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Here is the translation:\n\n1. **Understanding the modular equivalence**: When we say \\( n \\mod 2 = 0 \\), it means that when \\( n \\) is divided by 2, the remainder is zero. This happens precisely when \\( n \\) is an even number.\n\n2. **Use CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff \\( (ZMod 2) \\) theorem**: This theorem states that for any natural number \\( n \\), the equality \\( n \\mod p = 0 \\) (where \\( p \\) is a prime number, here 2) is equivalent to \\( p \\) dividing \\( n \\). Applying this for \\( p = 2 \\), we get \\( n \\mod 2 = 0 \\) if and only if 2 divides \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Symmetrical rewriting with even_iff_two_dvd**: The theorem even_iff_two_dvd states that a number \\( n \\) is even if and only if 2 divides \\( n \\). Thus, by transitivity, we can rewrite the equivalence as \\( n \\mod 2 = 0 \\iff \\text{2 divides } n\\ \\iff n \\text{ is even}\\).\n\nIn simpler terms, the proof shows that saying a number \\( n \\) leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 (i.e., \\( n \\mod 2 = 0 \\)) is the same as saying that \\( n \\) is evenly divisible by 2, which is the definition of being even.

Given two elements `a` and `b` of type `\u03b1`, and a property `p` that can be applied to elements of `\u03b1`, the theorem states that if `p` holds for both `a` and `b`, then `p` also holds for `a \u2294 b`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof exploits the totality of the ordering on `\u03b1`, which guarantees for any two elements `a` and `b` in `\u03b1`, either `a \u2264 b` or `b \u2264 a`. This total ordering allows us to consider two cases for proving the statement:\n\n1. **Case 1:** `a \u2264 b`. In this case, `a \u2294 b` is equal to `b` because, by the definition of supremum, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then the supremum of `a` and `b` is just `b`. Since `p(b)` is true (as given), and `a \u2294 b` is equivalent to `b`, it follows that `p(a \u2294 b)` is true.\n\n2. **Case 2:** `b \u2264 a`. Similarly, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a \u2294 b` is equal to `a` by the definition of supremum. Given that `p(a)` is true, and `a \u2294 b` is equivalent to `a`, it then follows that `p(a \u2294 b)` is also true.\n\nThe proof technique involves a straightforward application of the total ordering property and the definitions related to the supremum operation. By considering both cases that the total order allows, and applying the given property `p` to the results, the theorem demonstrates that if `p` holds individually for `a` and `b`, it must also hold for their supremum `a \u2294 b`.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This is what `IsTotal.total a b` ensures.\n2. **Case 1 - `a \u2264 b`:** If `a \u2264 b`, then `a \u2294 b` simplifies to `b`. This is because in a totally ordered set, the least upper bound of `a` and `b` when `a \u2264 b` is `b`. We can rewrite `a \u2294 b` as `b` using `sup_eq_right.2 h`, where `h` is the assumption `a \u2264 b`. Given `hb : p b`, we conclude that `p (a \u2294 b)` holds by substituting `a \u2294 b` with `b`.\n3. **Case 2 - `b \u2264 a`:** Similarly, if `b \u2264 a`, then `a \u2294 b` simplifies to `a`. This is because the least upper bound of `a` and `b` when `b \u2264 a` is `a`. We rewrite `a \u2294 b` as `a` using `sup_eq_left.2 h`, where `h` is the assumption `b \u2264 a`.

        "input": "Statement and proof in natural language:\n# Statement:\nThe problem statement is about proving a specific property of distance within the context of a completion of a uniform space. The statement to prove is that the distance between any element \\(x\\) in the completed space and itself is equal to zero. In more formal terms, for any element \\(x\\) in the completion of a uniform space \\(\\alpha\\), the distance from \\(x\\) to \\(x\\) is 0.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs the method of induction on the element \\(x\\) in the completion of the uniform space, which is a common technique in mathematical proofs that involve showing a property holds for all members of a set by breaking the problem down into more manageable parts.\n\n1. **First Step: Setup for Induction**\n   The proof begins by setting up for induction on \\(x\\), which involves showing that the property we want to prove (in this case, that the distance of \\(x\\) to itself is 0) holds for all elements \\(x\\) in the completion of the space. This setup involves specifying two cases to handle all possible elements \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Second Step: Proving the Base Case**\n   - The base case involves proving that the equation holds under the assumption that \\(x\\) can be approached by a sequence of points in the space \\(\\alpha\\). This is done by showing that the equation for the distance is continuous and equals to a constant function (in this case, zero), by leveraging the fact that the distance function is continuous when both of its arguments are the same (the identity function in this case).\n\n3. **Third Step: Proving for an Arbitrary Element \\(a\\)**\n   - For any specific element \\(a\\) in the original space, the proof shows that the distance from \\(a\\) to itself, when considered within the completion space, is 0. This is demonstrated by referencing the property of the distance function in the original space (before completion), which states that the distance of any point to itself is 0. This step relies on the definition of the distance in the completion space being consistent with the distance in the original space for points that are in the original space.\n\n4. **Conclusion**\n   - The proof concludes by linking back to the general induction principle applied at the start, showing that since the property holds for the base case and for an arbitrary element \\(a\\), it holds for all elements \\(x\\) in the completion of the space.\n\nThe lemma and its proof in Lean4 syntax thus demonstrate a foundational property of metric spaces (and their completions): any point's distance to itself is always zero. This is a reflection of the identity property of distances in metric spaces, extended to the context of the completion of a uniform space.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The completion of a metric space can be thought of as adding limit points to the space such that every Cauchy sequence has a limit in this completion. The proof proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Induction on `x`**: The proof applies induction on the element `x`. This means it considers two cases:\n   - When `x` is an actual element of the metric space `\u03b1`.\n   - When `x` is a limit of elements of the metric space `\u03b1`.\n\n2. **Case 1: `x` is a basic element of `\u03b1`**:\n   - The proof shows that in this case, the distance function is continuous, and hence, the distance between `x` and itself is constant and equal to 0. This relies on the theorem that states the distance function `dist(x, x)` for any single element `x` in a metric space is always 0.\n\n3. **Case 2: `x` is a limit of elements from `\u03b1`**:\n   - In this case, the proof considers a representative element `a` in `\u03b1` such that `x` is equivalent to the limit of `a`.\n   - Since `a` is just a point in the metric space, it uses previously known results: the distance between `a` and itself `dist(a, a)` is 0.\n   - By substituting into the representation for the completion, it concludes that the distance between `x` (which is `a` in this case) and itself is 0.\n\nSummarizing the proof in simpler terms, the proof shows that for any element `x` in the completion of the metric space, whether it is an actual element of the space or a limit of such elements, the distance between `x` and itself is always 0, respecting the definition of distance in a metric space. The induction step ensures that this property holds true for all elements in the completion."

In simpler terms, it claims that the set of integers greater than `a` and less than `b` is the same as the set of integers greater than or equal to `a+1` and less than `b`.\n\n# Proof: \nThe proof of this theorem is carried out by showing that any integer `x` belongs to the interval `Ico a.succ b` if and only if it belongs to the interval `Ioo a b`. This is done through the following steps:\n\n1. **Extensionality principle**: The proof begins by applying the extensionality principle, which in this context means showing that two sets are equal by proving that any element belongs to one set if and only if it belongs to the other set. This is indicated by the `ext x` command, which sets up the goal to prove the equivalence for an arbitrary integer `x`.\n\n2. **Rewriting using definitions**: The next step involves rewriting the membership conditions for `x` in both intervals using their definitions. The `rw` command is used to replace the expressions `mem_Ico` and `mem_Ioo` with their definitions:\n   - `mem_Ico` means `a.succ \u2264 x \u2227 x < b`, which translates to `x` being greater than or equal to `a+1` and less than `b`.\n   - `mem_Ioo` means `a < x \u2227 x < b`, which translates to `x` being greater than `a` and less than `b`.\n\n3. **Applying the `succ_le_iff` lemma**: The `succ_le_iff` lemma states that for any integers `a` and `x`, the statement `a.succ \u2264 x` is equivalent to `a < x`. This is applied to simplify the condition `a.succ \u2264 x` to `a < x`, making the conditions for membership in `Ico a.succ b` and `Ioo a b` identical.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the conditions for an integer `x` to belong to `Ico a.succ b` and `Ioo a b` have been shown to be equivalent, it follows that the two intervals are equal. This completes the proof.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that the set of integers strictly greater than `a` and less than `b` is the same as the set of integers greater than or equal to `a+1` and less than `b`, by showing that the conditions for an integer to belong to each set are equivalent.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This step is based on the general property that any face of a simplicial complex, by definition, lies within the convex hull of the vertices defining that face.

Specifically, it is shown that the convex hull of \\(s\\), which contains \\(s\\), is itself a subset of the space of \\(K\\).
