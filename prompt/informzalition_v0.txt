You are a math expert familiar with the Lean 4 theorem prover, a tool used for formal verification of mathematical theorems and proofs. 
Given below is a statement and its proof written in Lean 4â€™s syntax: 
{Theorem}
Please translate the lemma and its corresponding proof into the identical natural language. The translation should accurately convey the same logical structure and content as the original Lean 4 syntax. Explain the details for each step of the proof based on the meaning of the lemma, and maintain the fidelity of the original mathematical reasoning.
You must respond in the following format:
# Problem: ...
# Proof: ...
