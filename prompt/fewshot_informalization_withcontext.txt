Given a statement and its proof written in Lean 4’s syntax, please translate them into the semantically equivalent natural language that a human reader can independently understand without knowing any concepts in lean 4. The translation should accurately convey the same logical structure and content as the original statement and proof.
You need to explain the theorem and proof in the most intuitive terms possible, but also maintain the fidelity of the original mathematical reasoning. To do so, first translate the theorem statement into a natural language problem so that it does not contain any function in lean 4 (write after "# Problem:"). Then for the proof, you can explain each step of the proof in natural language based on the meaning of the lemma or tactic that is used (write after "# Explanation:"). Lastly and most importantly, write the step-by-step proof for the problem in natural language without mentioning verbatim any function in lean 4 (write after "# Proof:").
The definitions within the Lean 4 environment for some functions in the theorem may be additionally provided for translation context. Use the context to ensure that the final natural language proof can be understood independently without reading any function in lean 4.

# Theorem: theorem eq_zero_iff_even {n : \u2115} : (n : ZMod 2) = 0 \u2194 Even n :=\n (CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff (ZMod 2) 2 n).trans even_iff_two_dvd.symm\n
# Context: None
# Problem: Prove that for any natural number n, n is even if and only if n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.
# Explanation: The proof uses the following chain of reasoning:\n1. `CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff (ZMod 2) 2 n`: This lemma states that for any natural number n, n is congruent to 0 modulo 2 if and only if the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0.\n2. `even_iff_two_dvd.symm`: This lemma states that a number is even if and only if it is divisible by 2.\n3. `.trans`: This tactic combines the two lemmas by showing that if n is congruent to 0 modulo 2, then the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0, and therefore n is divisible by 2, which means n is even.
# Proof: We need to prove both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement.\n\n**Direction 1: If n is even, then n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.**\nIf n is even, then by definition, n is divisible by 2. This means that the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0.  Therefore, n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.\n\n**Direction 2: If n is congruent to 0 modulo 2, then n is even.**\nIf n is congruent to 0 modulo 2, then the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0. This implies that n is divisible by 2. Hence, n is even.\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we have shown that a natural number n is even if and only if n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.

# Theorem: theorem zero_of_to_zero {X : C} (f : X ⟶ 0) : f = 0 := by ext\n
# Context: None
# Problem: If there is a function from any object to a zero object, this function must be a zero function.
# Explanation: The proof uses `ext` tactic to show that the two functions are equal. The `ext` tactic proves the goal by showing that for every input, the two functions produce the same output.
# Proof: 1. We are given a function 'f' that maps from an object 'X' to a zero object, denoted as '0'.\n2. We need to demonstrate that the function 'f' is itself a zero function. \n3. Since the codomain of 'f' is a zero object, there is only one possible output for any input from the object 'X'.\n4. A zero function is a function that maps every input to a unique 'zero' element in the codomain.\n5. Because the function 'f' can only produce one output (due to the nature of the zero object as its codomain), this output must be the 'zero' element.\n6. Therefore, the function 'f' maps any input to the 'zero' element, satisfying the definition of a zero function. Thus, we have proven that f = 0.

# Theorem: theorem asq_pos : 0 < a * a :=\n   le_trans (le_of_lt a1)\n     (by have := @Nat.mul_le_mul_left 1 a a (le_of_lt a1); rwa [mul_one] at this)\n 
# Context: None
# Problem: Prove that the square of any natural number is greater than 0.
# Explanation: The proof uses the following steps:\n1. `a1`: This refers to the fact that `a` is greater than 0, which is a premise of the theorem.\n2. `le_of_lt a1`: This lemma states that if `a` is greater than 0, then 0 is less than or equal to `a`.\n3. `Nat.mul_le_mul_left 1 a a (le_of_lt a1)`: This lemma states that if 1 is less than or equal to `a` (which is true because `a` is a natural number and greater than 0), and 0 is less than or equal to `a` (from step 2), then 1 multiplied by `a` is less than or equal to `a` multiplied by `a`.\n4. `rwa [mul_one] at this`: This tactic rewrites the goal using the lemma `mul_one`, which states that 1 multiplied by any number is equal to that number. This simplifies the goal from `1 * a ≤ a * a` to `a ≤ a * a`.\n5. `le_trans`: This tactic combines the inequality `0 ≤ a` (from step 2) with the inequality `a ≤ a * a` (from step 4) to conclude that `0 < a * a`.
# Proof: 1. We know that 'a' is a natural number greater than 0.\n2. Since 'a' is greater than 0, we can say that 0 is less than or equal to 'a'.\n3. We can also say that 1 is less than or equal to 'a' because 'a' is a natural number and greater than 0.\n4. Multiplying both sides of the inequality '0 ≤ a' by 'a', we get '0 * a ≤ a * a'.\n5. Since multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, the inequality becomes '0 ≤ a * a'.\n6. We also know that multiplying any number by 1 doesn't change its value, so '1 * a' is the same as 'a'.\n7. Combining this with the fact that '1 ≤ a', we get 'a ≤ a * a'.\n8. Since 0 is less than or equal to 'a' and 'a' is less than or equal to 'a * a', we can conclude that 0 is strictly less than 'a * a'.\n9. Therefore, the square of any natural number is greater than 0.
