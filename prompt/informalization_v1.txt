Given a statement and its proof written in Lean 4â€™s syntax, please translate them into the semantically equivalent natural language that a human reader can understand. The translation should accurately convey the same logical structure and content as the original statement and proof. The definitions within the Lean 4 environment for some functions in the theorem may be additionally provided for context.
You need to explain the theorem and proof in the most intuitive terms possible, but also maintain the fidelity of the original mathematical reasoning. To do so, first translate the theorem into a natural language problem. Then for the proof, you can explain each step of the proof in natural language based on the meaning of the lemma or tactic that is used. Lastly, based on your understanding of the proof logic, prove the problem in natural language step by step without mentioning the tactics verbatim in the original proof.
